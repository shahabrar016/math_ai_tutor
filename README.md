#  Math AI Tutor

An interactive AI math tutor using SymPy and Matplotlib libraries in Python to solve, explain, and visualize algebra/calculus problems, promoting engaging EdTech learning.

## Description
This project is a command-line AI tutor that handles math operations like solving equations, derivatives, integrals, limits, and simplifications. It provides step-by-step explanations, LaTeX outputs, and generates plots for visual understanding.

## Features
- Solves and explains math problems with SymPy.
- Visualizes functions and results using Matplotlib (saves plots as PNG).
- Supports algebra and calculus basics.
- Interactive CLI interface.

## Installation
Requires Python 3.6+. Install dependencies:  
`pip install sympy matplotlib numpy`  

 

## Usage
Run: `python math_tutor_enhanced.py`  
Example queries:  
- "solve x**2 - 4 = 0"  
- "differentiate x**3 + sin(x)"  
- "integrate 2*x"  
- "limit sin(x)/x at 0"  
- "simplify (x**2 + x - 6)/(x - 2)"  
Type 'exit' to quit. Plots save in the current directory.
